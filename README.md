Code for thesis analysis 

Replication data includes 
1) Rmd file that runs all the summary statistics and tests that comprised the quantitative part of my undergraduate thesis.
2) `signs.csv` which is hardcoded into the Rmd file.
3) .Rproj file produced when running analysis

Let me know if you have any questions!
